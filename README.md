## Versioning

Durable Better Prospecting uses an adapted [SemVer](https://semver.org/) system, where the `MAJOR` component always corresponds to Vintage Story's `MINOR` component of the version the build is for.

For example, if version `1.0` of Durable Better Prospecting is built for Vintage Story version `1.21.x`, then the complete version of that mod file will be `21.1.0`.

This is very similar to what a lot of Minecraft mods do, and you can read more about it [here](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/gettingstarted/versioning/#including-the-minecraft-version).
